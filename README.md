## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive tool that can help Brototype students estimate their expected salary range based on their skills, experience, and demographics. The project will involve collecting data from previously graduated students, including their domains, skills, age, experience, and placed salary. This data will be analyzed to identify patterns and trends and develop a predictive model that can estimate the expected salary range for new graduates based on their skills and demographics.

The tool will provide insights into the key skills and domains that are in high demand in the job market, helping graduates to focus on developing the skills that will make them more competitive. By empowering Brototype graduates to negotiate better salaries with recruiters based on the real value of their skills and experience, this tool will benefit both graduates and recruiters in the industry.

Overall, the project aims to help Brototype graduates make informed decisions about their careers and increase their earning potential by developing a data-driven tool that provides valuable insights into the job market.

## Deliverables

1. Data Collection API for graduates to submit their domain, skills, age, experience, and placed salary information securely to the database.
2. Web-based Dashboard and KPIs to display relevant industry trends and key performance indicators such as the most in-demand skills and average salaries by domain.
3. Machine Learning Model for estimating the expected salary range of Brototype graduates based on their skills, experience, and demographic information.
4. Web Application that allows Brototype graduates to input their information and receive an estimated salary range, integrating with the data collection API and machine learning model.


These deliverables will enable Brototype graduates to make informed decisions about their careers and negotiate better salaries with recruiters.
